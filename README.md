this is a js script that can download practically any video on the web, given that it's tagged as a video element (tested on youtube, and 9animetv).
the way this works is by simply recording the element.
which would have been a problem, if not for the fact that its possible to record portions of the video
(thus making it possible to have multiple clients downloaing the video at once)
